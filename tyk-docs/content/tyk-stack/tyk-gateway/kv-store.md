Tyk Gateway as of 3.0 supports storing secrets in KV systems such as [Vault](https://vaultproject.io), [Consul](https://consul.io). You can reference these values from the KV store in your `tyk.conf` or API definition.
This has many benefits such as:
- Allows for ease of updating secrets across multiple machines rather than
  having to manually update each and everyone of them.
- Allows for proper separation of concerns. Developers don't have access to
  these secrets. Devops and/or only authorised people do and just pass along the
  name used to store the secret in the KV store.
- Using the local "secrets" section inside tyk.conf allows you to have per gateway variables, like machine ID, and inject it as part of headers or body.

## Supported engines

- Consul
- Vault
- Local secrets section inside config.

Example configuration inside `tyk.conf`

```
{
  "kv": {
    "consul": {
      "address": "localhost:8025",
      "scheme": "http",
      "datacenter": "dc-1",
      "timeout": 30,
      "http_auth": {
        "username": "username",
        "password": "password"
      },
      "wait_time": 10,
      "token": "Token if available",
      "tls_config": {
        "address": "",
        "ca_path": "",
        "ca_file": "",
        "cert_file": "",
        "key_file": "",
        "insecure_skip_verify": false
      }
    },
    "vault": {
      "address": "http://localhost:1023",
      "agent_adress": "input if available",
      "max_retries": 3,
      "timeout": 30,
      "token": "token if available",
      "kv_version": 2
    }
  },
  "secrets": {
  "gateway": "secret"
  }
}
```

## Usage information

The KV system can be used in the following places:

- Configuration file - `tyk.conf`
- API Definition: currently, only the listen path and target URL
- Body transforms and URL rewrites


For using inside the Tyk configuration file, target URL and listen path, pls use the following notation:

| Store                           | Example|
| --------------------------------| -----:|
| Consul                          | `consul://path/to/value`                           |
| Vault                           | `vault://engine/path/to/secret.actual_secret_name` |
| Configuration file              | `secrets://value`                                  |


For body transforms and URL rewrites, the prefixes are `$secret_vault.`, `$secret_consul.` and `$secret_conf.`

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

For Vault, you need to specify like
``vault://engine/path/to/secret.actual_secret_name``.

Vault is a little different as per how it keeps secrets, multiple secrets can be under
one key.

So we use the dot notation for retrieving the exact one we need such as
below:
{{< /note >}}


If you want to set local "secrets" section as environment variable, you should use the following notation:
`TYK_GW_SECRETS=key:value,key2:value2`
